## **📝 Task 1: Project Scaffolding & i18n Setup**

**Prompt:** Act as a Senior React Developer. Please initialize the project structure for "Girandola Localizzatore".

1. Set up a new Next.js App Router project structure.  
2. Install `next-intl` for internationalization.  
3. Configure middleware to detect browser locale (English vs Italian) and redirect accordingly.  
4. Create a generic Layout that allows for a manual language switcher (a simple dropdown or toggle) in the top navigation bar.  
5. Create `messages/en.json` and `messages/it.json` with basic translation keys for "Home", "Login", and "Language".

Do not implement Auth or Maps yet. Focus solely on the structure and localization wiring.
